# Kodi-JioTv
A light weight Kodi v19 backup, configured to exclusively run botallen JioTV addon.
Using my backup, you can skip all your effort needed to configure KODI along with JioTV & Hotstar addons.

Download the zip file from the Release section of the github.

Prerequisite
  Installing a official KODI Add-on:Backup
	This add-on is installed from the Add-on browser located in Kodi as follows:
	Settings -> Add-ons -> Install from repository -> Program Add-ons -> Backup -> Install

Note : By restoring a backup using my zip files, all your configuration saved in your KODI will be erased, do at your own risk, don't blame me.

  Restoration process to use this lightweight configuration
	1. Place the below zip file in your preferred location on the system where the Kodi is installed.
		https://github.com/vivin-neelankavil/Kodi-JioTv/releases/download/v1.0/202202202144.zip
	2. Set the backup & restoration location in the backup addon
		Settings -> Add-ons -> My addons -> Program Add-ons -> Backup -> Settings -> Remote Dir -> Browse remote Path -> (type/choose the location zip file is placed)
	3. Restore the backup
		Settings -> Add-ons -> My addons -> Program Add-ons -> Backup -> Run -> Restore
	4. The restroation process will request restart of your Kodi so just follow the steps as required.
	5. Sometimes you may have to manually change the skin to 'Quartz' to set things right.
